## Why Your Credits Disappear

Manus charges credits per task. Most users waste **30–75%** because of four default behaviors:

| Problem | What Happens | Waste |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| **Wrong model routing** | Simple tasks run in Max mode when Standard produces identical results | Up to **5x overpay** |
| **Slow browser navigation** | Each page takes 8–45 seconds via browser tool calls, burning credits on wait time | **150+ seconds** per 10 URLs |
| **No chat detection** | Tasks that cost $0 in Chat Mode (Q&A, brainstorm, translation) run in Agent Mode | **100% overpay** |
| **Context bloat** | Tokens accumulate across steps — each subsequent step costs more than the last | **Exponential growth** |

These aren't bugs. They're default settings. The Power Stack overrides all four.

---

## Zero Downsides

This is the most important thing to understand:

> **The Power Stack can never make things worse.** It has a hardcoded Quality Veto Rule: if an optimization would reduce output quality by even 1%, it skips that optimization entirely. In the worst case, it does nothing. In the best case, it saves you 75%.

There is no scenario where installing the Power Stack produces a worse result than not having it.

---

## What's Inside

### Credit Optimizer v5 — Smart Routing

Analyzes every prompt before execution and decides the cheapest path that delivers identical quality.

- **Intent Classification** across 12 categories (code, research, creative, data, translation...)
- **Model Routing**: Standard vs Max — only uses Max when complexity genuinely requires it
- **Chat Mode Detection**: Routes simple Q&A to Chat Mode ($0 cost)
- **Batch Detection**: Groups related tasks to reduce overhead
- **Context Hygiene**: Compresses accumulated context to keep token costs linear
- **Clarification Gate**: Uses `CLARIFY_FIRST` for empty, unknown, or materially vague prompts
- **Negation-aware actions**: Does not treat “não crie” or equivalent negations as execution requests
- **Boundary-aware matching**: Avoids substring errors such as matching `api` inside `capital`
- **Task aliases**: Normalizes common labels such as `Q&A`, `coding`, `data`, and `media_generation`

### Fast Navigation v2.0 — Raw Speed

Replaces slow browser tool calls with a programmatic toolkit.

- **httpx + selectolax** replaces Playwright overhead (30–2,000x faster)
- **Browser Cookie Bridge** for authenticated sites
- **Async parallel fetching** — 10 URLs in 1.3 seconds instead of 150+ seconds
- **Intelligent disk caching** with TTL — repeated visits are instant

### Together: The Compound Effect

Credit Optimizer decides **what** to optimize. Fast Navigation decides **how fast** to execute it. Together, they multiply:

| Metric | Without Stack | With Stack | Improvement |
|--------|--------------|------------|-------------|
| Simple Q&A cost | Full price | $0 (Chat Mode) | **100% saved** |
| 10-URL research | 150+ seconds | 1.3 seconds | **115x faster** |
| Web scraping task | Full credits | 33% of original | **67% saved** |
| Full-stack web app | Full credits | 40% of original | **60% saved** |
| Research report | 12 minutes | 2 minutes | **6x faster** |
| Average across all tasks | Baseline | 47% less | **47% saved** |

---

## The Math: Payback in ~36 prompts

The Power Stack costs $9 one-time (or $12 for the bundle with Fast Navigation). Here's how fast it pays for itself:

| Plan | Monthly Cost | 47% Wasted | Daily Waste | Payback |
|------|-------------|------------|-------------|---------|
| Plus ($39/mo) | 6,500 cr/day | ~3,055 cr/day | ~$0.44/day | **~20 prompts** |
| Max ($99/mo) | 16,250 cr/day | ~7,637 cr/day | ~$0.92/day | **~10 prompts** |
| Teams ($79/user/mo) | Varies | ~47% | Varies | **1–2 days** |

After payback, every prompt saves you money. For the rest of your Manus subscription. Forever.

**Annual savings estimate: ~$500–$1,000+** depending on usage.

## Installation

### As Manus Skill (recommended — $9 individual / $12 bundle)

1. Purchase from [Gumroad](https://rafaamaral.gumroad.com/l/credit-optimizer-v5) or [SkillFlow](https://skillflow.builders/skill/manus-power-bundle-mn7p4h88)
2. Copy skill files to `~/skills/credit-optimizer/` and `~/skills/fast-navigation/`
3. Both activate automatically on every task — no configuration needed

### As Native Manus MCP Server (free — Credit Optimizer only)

```bash
python3 -m pip install mcp-credit-optimizer
mcp-credit-optimizer
```

Add to your MCP config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "credit-optimizer": {
      "command": "mcp-credit-optimizer",
      "args": []
    }
  }
}
```

Works with Manus and any MCP-compatible client.

> **Why pay when the MCP server is free?** The MCP server saves credits when you remember to call it. The Manus Skill saves credits on **every single prompt automatically** — no manual invocation needed. The Skill also includes Fast Navigation (115x speed boost), which is not available as MCP.
