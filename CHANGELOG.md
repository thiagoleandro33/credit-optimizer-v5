## [5.3.0] - 2026-08-18

### Added
- Added `CLARIFY_FIRST` for empty, unknown, or materially vague prompts.
- Added multilingual normalization for accents, word boundaries, and common task-type aliases.

- Added regression coverage for automation, media refinement, ambiguous prompts, invalid inputs, substring noise, and MCP aliases.

### Changed
- Improved mixed-task detection to require explicit connective language and a second action.
